## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate second-year student in computer science with a solid foundation in data structures, algorithms, and programming; and a current Hackademy 2 volunteer.
I'm enthusiastic about problem-solving and constantly improving technical skills through independent work and courses.
I'm eager to use their knowledge in a real-world situation by doing an internship.
